- **Modal Labs GPU Quota**: Ensure sufficient GPU resources for concurrent processing
- **Frontend Contracts**: API specification agreement with frontend development
- **Database Migration Strategy**: Safe schema extension without downtime

## Evolution of Architectural Decisions

### Technology Stack Reuse
1. **Initial Assessment**: Considered building separate backend
2. **Current Decision**: Extend existing YouTube transcription system
3. **Reasoning**: Leverage proven infrastructure, reduce development time, maintain stability

### Processing Architecture
1. **Pipeline Design**: Sequential processing with error recovery at each stage
2. **Real-time Strategy**: Hybrid approach supporting both live streams and batch processing
3. **AI Integration**: Modular design allowing for easy swapping of AI providers

### Data Architecture
1. **Database Strategy**: Extend existing PostgreSQL schema with debate-specific tables
2. **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching (memory, Redis, database) for performance
3. **Storage Strategy**: Reuse existing audio processing and storage patterns
